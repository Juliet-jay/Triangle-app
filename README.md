# triangle-tracker
The project determines the nature of a triangle.It provides for users to enter three numerical values and determine the nature of the triangle.
It will be an equilateral triangle if all sides are equal,an isosceles triangle if any two sides are equal and a scalene triangle if neither side is equal to the other.

it can find out if the triangle is equilateral,scalene,or isosceles.
It does not integrate any other applications.
